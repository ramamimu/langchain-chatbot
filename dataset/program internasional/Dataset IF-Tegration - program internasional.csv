INTERN RESEARCH TOPICS
Number P1
Project title
Trustable Artificial Intelligence for Critical Applications and
6G Security
Description of the research
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, 6G networking,
and quantum computing are the leading forces in
bringing the world to an era of better intelligence and full
automation. However, the rapid development of such
technologies raises concerns that they could be used to
damage human life, destroy critical infrastructure, and
further violate user privacy. For example, AI power can be
exploited to scan the vulnerabilities of critical control
systems (SCADA, ITS) or track a target user in a restricted
access building, even without physical intrusion. Similarly,
the attackers can launch adversarial attacks against AI-
based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
force connected vehicles to act as unexpected weapons
to hit civilians. Early detection of security attacks and
secure AI models are the top targets of many current
research efforts. In short, our lab is recruiting talents who
are interested in the following topics:
(1) AI for Cybersecurity: Misbehavior detection in
autonomous vehicles, Deep Reinforcement Learning for
aerial-assisted networks (UAV-satellite-space) or
Intelligent Transportation Systems, Self-supervised
Learning, autoDL /ML for Intrusion Detection Systems.
(2) Cybersecurity for AI: Trustable AI for automated
vehicles and AI-based control systems from adversarial
attacks.
(3) 6G security: Signal sensing, physical layer
authentication, high-accuracy localization and sensing.
(4) Space and Quantum security: Blockchain for
vehicular/aerial networks; Quantum - safe
vehicular/aerial networks; Quantum - compatible IDS
platforms.
About CISLab: CIS Lab is a leading security research group
at National Chung Cheng University, established by Prof.
Van-Linh Nguyen. CISLab has been the home of many
international students. Students are diverse and come
from many countries, e.g., Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand,
Malaysia, Ethiopia, Iran, and India. Our research interests

Project title
A Study of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter-based
Resources for Low-Inertia Microgrid/Grid with Virtual Inertia
and Grid Voltage Support Functions
Description of the research
Massive integration of inverter-based renewable energy
systems (IBRs) has been displacing conventional
synchronous generators and causing a reduction in system
inertia. IBRs are integrated into power grids through power-
electronics inverters. These are generally categorized as (i)
grid-following (GFL) and (ii) grid-forming (GFM) inverters.
The GFM inverter is a promising emerging technology that
generates its own voltage signal and has the capability to
regulate the frequency and voltage at the point of
interconnection. GFM and GFL with virtual inertia and grid
voltage support functions are in great demand when the
penetration level of IBRs in the grid is high. The simulation-
based research project will focus on investigating the
potential applications to enhance low-inertia microgrid/grid
resilience and stability when the grid is subjected to minor
or large disturbances.

Project title
Simulation and Reconstruction of Pencil Beam Scanning of
Particle Therapy
Description of the research
Pencil beam scanning in particle therapy is one of the
highlight radiation therapies for cancer treatment. Due to
the effectively and precisely control for particle-beam, the
narrow pulse and extremely high radiation dose rate
delivering becomes more and more significant. Basically,
the high dose rate will enable the recombination of the ion
pair effect, and it can lead to the received signal
underestimated. In addition, the higher spatial resolution
and wide field of view is necessary. So, the main purpose of
the project is to develop a novel algorithm to reconstruct
the 2D image of the extremely high dose rate in
proton/particle therapies. We hope that the students could
join us to implement a novel reconstruction algorithm and
try to publish the research work in intern period.

Description of the research
Atmospheric-pressure plasma jets have been developed
extensively for applications such as plasma medicine and
plasma agriculture due to the generation of abundant
reactive species being critical for manipulating reaction
pathways in different fields. Therefore, it is essential to
characterize the densities of reactive species introduced
by plasma jets in the liquid phase for various applications.
In this project, the densities of OH/NO2
-/NO3
- will be
explored by using the microplate reader
spectrophotometer under different operating conditions
to reveal the correlations among reactive species
generated in the liquid phase and the discharge
parameters. Anyone interested in plasma technology and
characterization is welcome to join the project.

Numerical modeling and Experiments of an atmospheric
pressure plasma jet operated in air with shielding gas
Description of the research
Atmospheric-pressure plasma jets have been developed
extensively for applications such as plasma medicine and
plasma agriculture due to the generation of abundant
reactive species being critical for manipulating reaction
pathways in different fields. However, it is still challenging
to develop a proper plasma source with controlled
parameters by experimental measurements because of
fast discharge dynamics and complex plasma chemistry.
Alternatively, numerical simulations can be used to
capture discharge dynamics with detailed chemistry
revealed. In this project, a two-dimensional axisymmetric
plasma fluid model will be integrated with a two-
dimensional axisymmetric gas flow model to predict the
dynamic behavior of a helium atmospheric pressure
plasma jet. The simulated results will be compared with
photos taken by an intensified CCD camera to validate the
model. It is a topic involving thermofluid science, which is
suitable for students in mechanical engineering.

Description of the
research
The early detection of esophageal cancer presents a
considerable difficulty, which contributes to its high
prevalence as a major cause of cancer-related fatalities. This
project will utilize various machine learning models, including
YOLOv5, YOLOv8, R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN, to predict and
detect early-stage esophageal cancer. It will make use of two
models of esophageal cancer images: the white-light images
(WLI) model and the hyperspectral narrowband images (HSI-
NBI) model. These models will be generated through a
conversion algorithm referred to as the spectrum-aided
vision enhancer (SAVE). The main goal will be to discover
Dysplasia and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The
evaluation of model performance will be conducted using the
created confusion matrix and five important indicators:
precision, recall, F1-score, mAP, and the confusion matrix of
the trained model.

About the Course
The course starts with the introduction of image which is a two-dimensional grid with
each cell in the grid filled with a finite value, called a pixel value. An image may be
defined as a two-dimensional function, f(x, y). where x and y are spatial coordinates,
and the amplitude off at any pair of coordinates (x, y) is called the intensity or gray
level of the image at that point. When x, y, and the amplitude values of f are all finite,
discrete quantities, we call the image a digital image. The field of digital image
processing refers to processing digital images by means of a digital computer.
This course will provide the basic concepts and techniques of digital image processing
which is the preliminary knowledge to get in to the computer vision applied at artificial
Intelligence.
The Course Features
Digital image processing (DIP) encompasses processes whose inputs and outputs are
images and, in addition, includes processes that extract attributes from images up to,
and including, the recognition of individual objects. Starting from the introduction of
DIP, it gives a description of fundamental of DIP and Intensity transformation before
the mid-term exam. After that the color image processing and image segmentation
are provided. The processes of acquiring an image, preprocessing that image,
extracting (segmenting) the individual characters, describing the characters in a form
suitable for computer processing, and recognizing those individual characters are
included in this course.

About the Course
The course starts with the introduction of R language which is now widely used by
financial researchers and practitioners in their daily work. Similar to Python which is
also a very popular open-source programming language with a large community, R
provides many packages and functionalities to work with financial data and statistical
analysis. Because of its powerful communication libraries, R is one of the top languages
applied in statistics, data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which
will be the topics the course plans to cover.
The Course Features
We will help students to learn R language through lecturing, course materials,
textbook and hands-on implementation examples. Amazon Web Service will also be
adopted so that students can run their R codings on the cloud in any time in any place.
Data analysis and management will be necessary for students to build up basic
knowledge using R. Then the presentation of data in plotting is also important to help
readers to understand the critical difference in data. Machine learning and data mining
will also be introduced to students so that they can implement in real case studies.

About the Course
Data scientist has been called “the great potential job of the 21st century,” presumably
by someone who has never visited a fire station. Nonetheless, data science is a hot
and growing field, and it doesn’t take a great deal of sleuthing to find analysts
breathlessly prognosticating that over the next 10 years, we’ll need billions and billions
more data scientists than we currently have.
But what is data science? After all, we can’t produce data scientists if we don’t know
what data science is. According to a Venn diagram that is somewhat famous in the
industry, data science lies at the intersection of:
1. Math and statistics knowledge
2. Substantive expertise
The Course Features
The goal of this course is to help you develop skills those you need to get started doing
data science. Our goal is to help you get comfortable with the mathematics and
statistics that are at the core of data science.
By this course, you will get a good understanding of SAS Enterprise Guide for data
collection, data cleaning, data queries and data transformation. In addition, you will
learn about the SAS Enterprise Mining to analysis the real big data set, diagnose and
assessment of data model. You will get a good understanding of the way we approach
data problems, which may not necessarily be the best way for you to approach data
problems. Similarly, the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics. This
means that, where appropriate, we will dive into mathematical equations,
mathematical intuition, mathematical axioms, and cartoon versions of big
mathematical ideas. Throughout it all, we hope to give you a sense that playing with
data is fun, because, well, playing with data is fun!

Instructor: Mr. Matthias Wetzel (wetzel@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
This course introduces the participants to the fundamentals of trademark protection
and the trademark system. It is suitable for both students with and without a legal
background.
The Course Features
The topics included cover the function of trademarks and trademark systems, the
various types and forms of trademarks available, the steps necessary to acquire
trademark protection both within the national and the international system, the
differences between registration-only trademark systems and those systems which
allow for extended protection (trademarks through use, trade dress etc.). It explains
the particular legal hurdles and requirements a trademark applicant needs to
overcome in order to obtain registration and protection for his trademark (absolute
grounds for refusal). It demonstrates what happens when identical or similar
trademarks collide with each other (relative grounds for refusal and trademark
infringement respectively). It provides answers to the question what remedies a trade
mark owner is entitled to in case of infringement and how those remedies can be
enforced in court.

Instructor: Mr. Matthias Wetzel (wetzel@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
The course ‘Legal English’ strives to provide the participants with an introduction on
how to efficiently communicate and collaborate in English in a legal context such as
e.g. when negotiating and drafting contracts in international commerce, talking about
legal issues with foreign customers or advising international clients. This course is
suitable for both law and non-law students.
The Course Features
This course combines practical language training and exercises in English with an
introduction into the Anglo-American Legal System, also referred to as ‘The Common
Law System’ which serves as an indispensable foundation when reading and analyzing
legal texts and documents from a wide variety of sources, such as (draft) contracts,
term sheets and memoranda, client-attorney communication or judicial opinions
(cases). A particular focus thereby lies on developing the necessary skills and tools for
efficient communication in the context of international commercial law.
At the end of the program participants should have developed the practical skills
needed to:
 communicate more effectively in Legal English
 engage meaningfully with U.S. and other common law lawyers in an
international context
 identify critical legal issues in a range of business agreements
 analyze and critique contractual provisions from actual case studies offered by
opposing parties

Day of Week: Tuesday
Course Time: 10:10 am-12:00 pm (Taiwan time)
Grades: 4th
year
Credits: 2
Instructor: Mr. Matthias Wetzel (wetzel@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
This course strives to provide students to the fundamentals of trade secret protection.
It is suitable for both students with and without a legal background.
The Course Features
“What is a trade secret?”, “What means ‘Know-how’?”, “How can they be protected
and what are the requirements for their legal protection?”. These are some of the
questions that will be explained and answered to the students in this course.
Protection of know-how and trade secrets plays a vital and ever more important role
in a globalized and knowledge-based economy. Though seemingly cheap and
ubiquitous and therefore particularly attractive notably for small and medium-sized
companies with limited financial budgets and resources for IP protection, also trade
secret protection comes with its specific price: Existence and unlawful disclosure of a
trade secret are difficult to prove; unlike for patents an other IP rights a uniform
international legal framework for the protection of trade secrets does not yet exist.
Therefore, this course aims to provide the participants with an insight in both, the
chances but also the practical and legal problems and risks that come with trade secret
protection.

& 4th
year
Credits: 3
Instructor: Dr. Chih-Bang Hsiao (chb-hsiao@asia.edu.tw)/ Dr. Song-Lin
Huang (slh4221@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
The course starts with introducing social policy and legislation concepts, such as social
policy history, definition, related theory, and perspectives from different angles. It
then proceeds to apply the concepts in social work practices by inviting the
international students at Asia University to work with clients to help clients recover
from struggling in a difficult time. Social policy and social legislation are essential parts
of ""indirect service"" in social work. The standard, definition, and effect of ""direct
service"" play a vital role. Therefore, as a learner of social work, in addition to the study
of direct service and its skills, it is also necessary to understand the connotation,
history, and related theories of social policy, and have an understanding of social
legislation in various fields. The connotation is applied beyond the direct service. It
can deduct or evaluate its impact on the direct service based on social policies from
different positions and analyze the pros and cons of various policies.
The Course Features
The course aims to cultivate students’ abilities to analyze and link social policies and
direct services. They would also gain knowledge of the relevant theories, concepts, or
ideologies learned in the course to deduce its policy connotation and influence, and
further provide insights on the revision of policies and laws in Taiwan.
Starting from the needs of the service target, assess and criticize the impact of relevant
policies or regulations on the service target so that the formulation of social policies
can better meet the service target's needs. Meanwhile, students will have Social
welfare-related institutions field visit through video camera(s).

42. Product Semantics
Department: Creative Product Design
Week of day: Tuesday
Course Time: 13:10 pm-16:00 pm (Taiwan time)
Grades: 3rd
year
Credits: 2
Instructor: Dr. Ching-Yi Wang (spacecat@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
This course focuses on practicality, and more about the use of design methods, such
as the guiding role of product instructional semantics on human operation and
emotional semantics on human emotions, which can promote the development of
humanized design. The method of semantic design is based on the synesthesia
produced by the mutual influence of semantic stimuli on different senses. This course
uses more contrasting techniques to enhance the fun of reading, such as modifying
the existing products to generate new semantic meanings, allowing students to
understand the influence of each link of the shape on semantic features. In addition,
looking for emotional resonance in life as a starting point for semantic design methods,
etc., can enable students to understand the value of semantics in design in a relatively
short period of time, and find a design breakthrough that suits them.
The Course Features
This course starts from the angle that students can accept and understand more easily,
expound the basic knowledge of semantics in a more cordial way, and summarize some
semantic design methods.

Perihal : Pemberitahuan Informasi Persyaratan Eksposur Internasional
Kepada Yth.
Kepala Departemen dan Ketua Program Studi
di lingkungan ITS
Dengan hormat,
sehubungan dengan surat kami dengan nomor 7311/!T2.VINI/T/TU.00.08/2023 perihal Pemberitahuan Informasi Persyaratan
Eksposur Internasional, bersama dengan ini memberikan informasi lebih lanjut tentang persyaratan yang harus dipenuhi oleh
seluruh mahasiswa ITS dalam rangka pelaksanaan kegiatan eksposur internasional. Persyaratan tersebut adalah sebagai berikut:

1. Setiap mahasiswa ITS yang ingin mendaftar program internasional di perguruan tinggi mitra ITS luar negeri yang
membutuhkan surat rekomendasi atau dana dukungan dari ITS di antaranya IISMA/IISMA-Vo, pertukaran pelajar (exchange),
lab-internship, short program, atau program lain di luar negeri, diharuskan memiliki sertifikat Global Competency
Workshop (GCW) atau Global Competency Academy (GCA). Sertifikat ini hanya bisa diperoleh dengan mengikuti program
GCW atau GCA.

2. GCA adalah program persiapan Study Abroad yang berlangsung selama 8 pertemuan selama 8 pekan dan diselenggarakan
satu kali setahun. Program ini sangat sesuai bagi mahasiswa yang ingin mempersiapkan diri secara mendalam. Sementara
itu, GCW adalah program persiapan Study Abroad yang berlangsung selama 3 hari dan diadakan tiga kali dalam satu
semester. GCW lebih cocok bagi mahasiswa yang telah memiliki dasar pengetahuan. Untuk informasi lebih lanjut tentang
program ini, silahkan membaca detil informasi di https://www.its.ac.id/international/its-goes-global/students/global-
competencies-program/

3. Sertifikat GCA/GCW tidak diwajibkan bagi mahasiswa yang mengikuti kegiatan Studi Ekskursi (SE), Short Program in-country,
GPbL in-country, atau program internasionalisasi in-country lainnya yang diselenggarakan oleh ITS, serta program AIESEC,
lomba internasional, dan lain sebagainya yang tidak membutuhkan rekomendasi dan dukungan dana dari ITS.

4, Mahasiswa KIP/Bidik Misi atau mahasiswa yang kurang mampu dapat mendaftar GCW/GCA terlebih dahulu tanpa melakukan
pembayaran untuk kemudian dievaluasi. Beasiswa dan bebas biaya mengikuti GCW/GCA selalu dimungkinkan untuk
mahasiswa KIP/Bidik Misi yang memenuhi persyaratan.

5. Dengan memperhatikan poin 1, DKG menginformasikan bahwa Test GCW Non-Degree yang sebelumnya diselenggarakan
setiap bulan tidak akan lagi diselenggarakan, kecuali dalam kondisi yang sangat khusus, dengan mempertimbangkan surat
permohonan oleh mahasiswa yang diketahui oleh Kepala Departemen. Pelaksanaan Test GCW Non Degree akan diputuskan
oleh Direktur Kemitraan Global.
Bersama ini kami juga melampirkan poster informasi penyelenggaraan Global Competency Academy yang pendaftarannya dibuka
sampai dengan 17 September 2023. Kami mohon bantuan dari Bapak/Ibu Kepala Departemen dan Ketua Program Studi untuk
menyebarkan informasi ini kepada mahasiswa di departemen masing-masing.
Untuk pertanyaan lebih lanjut, kiranya dapat disampaikan melalui email studyabroad@its.ac.id , LINE Official @yao2114f , atau
melalui Instagram @itsinternationaloffice.
Demikian surat ini kami sampaikan. Atas perhatian dan kerjasamanya kami sampaikan terima kasih.
