INTERN RESEARCH TOPICS
Number P1
Project title
Trustable Artificial Intelligence for Critical Applications and
6G Security
Description of the research
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, 6G networking,
and quantum computing are the leading forces in
bringing the world to an era of better intelligence and full
automation. However, the rapid development of such
technologies raises concerns that they could be used to
damage human life, destroy critical infrastructure, and
further violate user privacy. For example, AI power can be
exploited to scan the vulnerabilities of critical control
systems (SCADA, ITS) or track a target user in a restricted
access building, even without physical intrusion. Similarly,
the attackers can launch adversarial attacks against AI-
based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and
force connected vehicles to act as unexpected weapons
to hit civilians. Early detection of security attacks and
secure AI models are the top targets of many current
research efforts. In short, our lab is recruiting talents who
are interested in the following topics:
(1) AI for Cybersecurity: Misbehavior detection in
autonomous vehicles, Deep Reinforcement Learning for
aerial-assisted networks (UAV-satellite-space) or
Intelligent Transportation Systems, Self-supervised
Learning, autoDL /ML for Intrusion Detection Systems.
(2) Cybersecurity for AI: Trustable AI for automated
vehicles and AI-based control systems from adversarial
attacks.
(3) 6G security: Signal sensing, physical layer
authentication, high-accuracy localization and sensing.
(4) Space and Quantum security: Blockchain for
vehicular/aerial networks; Quantum - safe
vehicular/aerial networks; Quantum - compatible IDS
platforms.
About CISLab: CIS Lab is a leading security research group
at National Chung Cheng University, established by Prof.
Van-Linh Nguyen. CISLab has been the home of many
international students. Students are diverse and come
from many countries, e.g., Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand,
Malaysia, Ethiopia, Iran, and India. Our research interests
consist of Information Security/Advanced authentication,
Cybersecurity in wireless communications, space/drone
security, quantum security, and vehicular networks.

Project title
A Study of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter-based
Resources for Low-Inertia Microgrid/Grid with Virtual Inertia
and Grid Voltage Support Functions
Description of the research
Massive integration of inverter-based renewable energy
systems (IBRs) has been displacing conventional
synchronous generators and causing a reduction in system
inertia. IBRs are integrated into power grids through power-
electronics inverters. These are generally categorized as (i)
grid-following (GFL) and (ii) grid-forming (GFM) inverters.
The GFM inverter is a promising emerging technology that
generates its own voltage signal and has the capability to
regulate the frequency and voltage at the point of
interconnection. GFM and GFL with virtual inertia and grid
voltage support functions are in great demand when the
penetration level of IBRs in the grid is high. The simulation-
based research project will focus on investigating the
potential applications to enhance low-inertia microgrid/grid
resilience and stability when the grid is subjected to minor
or large disturbances.

Project title Lidar and Camera fusion for autonomous driving
Description of the research
This project revolves around the integration of lidar and
camera sensor data, aiming to develop robust algorithms
for enhanced perception and decision-making in self-
driving systems. Interns will engage in the fusion of lidar
and camera inputs, leveraging Python and advanced
machine learning models. The primary objectives include
developing algorithms for sensor data calibration, point
cloud processing and image processing to create a
comprehensive and accurate representation of the
vehicle's surroundings. The primary objective is to develop
and optimize algorithms for efficiently processing and
interpreting the multi-modality. This includes tasks such as
semantic segmentation, feature extraction, and object
recognition, all of which are pivotal for the accurate
perception of the vehicle's surroundings.

Project title
Simulation and Reconstruction of Pencil Beam Scanning of
Particle Therapy
Description of the research
Pencil beam scanning in particle therapy is one of the
highlight radiation therapies for cancer treatment. Due to
the effectively and precisely control for particle-beam, the
narrow pulse and extremely high radiation dose rate
delivering becomes more and more significant. Basically,
the high dose rate will enable the recombination of the ion
pair effect, and it can lead to the received signal
underestimated. In addition, the higher spatial resolution
and wide field of view is necessary. So, the main purpose of
the project is to develop a novel algorithm to reconstruct
the 2D image of the extremely high dose rate in
proton/particle therapies. We hope that the students could
join us to implement a novel reconstruction algorithm and
try to publish the research work in intern period.

Measurements of densities of liquid-phase reactive
species generated by atmospheric pressure plasma jets
Description of the research
Atmospheric-pressure plasma jets have been developed
extensively for applications such as plasma medicine and
plasma agriculture due to the generation of abundant
reactive species being critical for manipulating reaction
pathways in different fields. Therefore, it is essential to
characterize the densities of reactive species introduced
by plasma jets in the liquid phase for various applications.
In this project, the densities of OH/NO2
-/NO3
- will be
explored by using the microplate reader
spectrophotometer under different operating conditions
to reveal the correlations among reactive species
generated in the liquid phase and the discharge
parameters. Anyone interested in plasma technology and
characterization is welcome to join the project.

Numerical modeling and Experiments of an atmospheric
pressure plasma jet operated in air with shielding gas
Description of the research
Atmospheric-pressure plasma jets have been developed
extensively for applications such as plasma medicine and
plasma agriculture due to the generation of abundant
reactive species being critical for manipulating reaction
pathways in different fields. However, it is still challenging
to develop a proper plasma source with controlled
parameters by experimental measurements because of
fast discharge dynamics and complex plasma chemistry.
Alternatively, numerical simulations can be used to
capture discharge dynamics with detailed chemistry
revealed. In this project, a two-dimensional axisymmetric
plasma fluid model will be integrated with a two-
dimensional axisymmetric gas flow model to predict the
dynamic behavior of a helium atmospheric pressure
plasma jet. The simulated results will be compared with
photos taken by an intensified CCD camera to validate the
model. It is a topic involving thermofluid science, which is
suitable for students in mechanical engineering.

Application of Novel Snap-shot based hyperspectral imaging
combined with AI to detect Lesions
Description of the
research
The early detection of esophageal cancer presents a
considerable difficulty, which contributes to its high
prevalence as a major cause of cancer-related fatalities. This
project will utilize various machine learning models, including
YOLOv5, YOLOv8, R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN, to predict and
detect early-stage esophageal cancer. It will make use of two
models of esophageal cancer images: the white-light images
(WLI) model and the hyperspectral narrowband images (HSI-
NBI) model. These models will be generated through a
conversion algorithm referred to as the spectrum-aided
vision enhancer (SAVE). The main goal will be to discover
Dysplasia and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The
evaluation of model performance will be conducted using the
created confusion matrix and five important indicators:
precision, recall, F1-score, mAP, and the confusion matrix of
the trained model.
