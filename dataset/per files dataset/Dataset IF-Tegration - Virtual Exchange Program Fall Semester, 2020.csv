About the Course
The course starts with the introduction of image which is a two-dimensional grid with
each cell in the grid filled with a finite value, called a pixel value. An image may be
defined as a two-dimensional function, f(x, y). where x and y are spatial coordinates,
and the amplitude off at any pair of coordinates (x, y) is called the intensity or gray
level of the image at that point. When x, y, and the amplitude values of f are all finite,
discrete quantities, we call the image a digital image. The field of digital image
processing refers to processing digital images by means of a digital computer.
This course will provide the basic concepts and techniques of digital image processing
which is the preliminary knowledge to get in to the computer vision applied at artificial
Intelligence.
The Course Features
Digital image processing (DIP) encompasses processes whose inputs and outputs are
images and, in addition, includes processes that extract attributes from images up to,
and including, the recognition of individual objects. Starting from the introduction of
DIP, it gives a description of fundamental of DIP and Intensity transformation before
the mid-term exam. After that the color image processing and image segmentation
are provided. The processes of acquiring an image, preprocessing that image,
extracting (segmenting) the individual characters, describing the characters in a form
suitable for computer processing, and recognizing those individual characters are
included in this course.

About the Course
To give students general knowledge of foreign cultures as well their own culture in
three different domains: theoretical, philosophical, and practical. Cross cultural
management involves managing work teams in ways that considers the differences in
cultures, practices and preferences of consumers in a global or international business
context. Many businesses have to learn to modify or adapt their approaches in order

About the Course
The course starts with the introduction of R language which is now widely used by
financial researchers and practitioners in their daily work. Similar to Python which is
also a very popular open-source programming language with a large community, R
provides many packages and functionalities to work with financial data and statistical
analysis. Because of its powerful communication libraries, R is one of the top languages
applied in statistics, data analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence, which
will be the topics the course plans to cover.
The Course Features
We will help students to learn R language through lecturing, course materials,
textbook and hands-on implementation examples. Amazon Web Service will also be
adopted so that students can run their R codings on the cloud in any time in any place.
Data analysis and management will be necessary for students to build up basic
knowledge using R. Then the presentation of data in plotting is also important to help
readers to understand the critical difference in data. Machine learning and data mining
will also be introduced to students so that they can implement in real case studies.

About the Course
Data scientist has been called “the great potential job of the 21st century,” presumably
by someone who has never visited a fire station. Nonetheless, data science is a hot
and growing field, and it doesn’t take a great deal of sleuthing to find analysts
breathlessly prognosticating that over the next 10 years, we’ll need billions and billions
more data scientists than we currently have.
But what is data science? After all, we can’t produce data scientists if we don’t know
what data science is. According to a Venn diagram that is somewhat famous in the
industry, data science lies at the intersection of:
1. Math and statistics knowledge
2. Substantive expertise
The Course Features
The goal of this course is to help you develop skills those you need to get started doing
data science. Our goal is to help you get comfortable with the mathematics and
statistics that are at the core of data science.
By this course, you will get a good understanding of SAS Enterprise Guide for data
collection, data cleaning, data queries and data transformation. In addition, you will
learn about the SAS Enterprise Mining to analysis the real big data set, diagnose and
assessment of data model. You will get a good understanding of the way we approach
data problems, which may not necessarily be the best way for you to approach data
problems. Similarly, the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics. This
means that, where appropriate, we will dive into mathematical equations,
mathematical intuition, mathematical axioms, and cartoon versions of big
mathematical ideas. Throughout it all, we hope to give you a sense that playing with
data is fun, because, well, playing with data is fun!

the particular legal hurdles and requirements a trademark applicant needs to
overcome in order to obtain registration and protection for his trademark (absolute
grounds for refusal). It demonstrates what happens when identical or similar
trademarks collide with each other (relative grounds for refusal and trademark
infringement respectively). It provides answers to the question what remedies a trade
mark owner is entitled to in case of infringement and how those remedies can be
enforced in court.

This course combines practical language training and exercises in English with an
introduction into the Anglo-American Legal System, also referred to as ‘The Common
Law System’ which serves as an indispensable foundation when reading and analyzing
legal texts and documents from a wide variety of sources, such as (draft) contracts,
term sheets and memoranda, client-attorney communication or judicial opinions
(cases). A particular focus thereby lies on developing the necessary skills and tools for
efficient communication in the context of international commercial law.
At the end of the program participants should have developed the practical skills
needed to:
 communicate more effectively in Legal English
 engage meaningfully with U.S. and other common law lawyers in an
international context
 identify critical legal issues in a range of business agreements
 analyze and critique contractual provisions from actual case studies offered by
opposing parties

Department: Financial and Economic Law
Day of Week: Tuesday
Course Time: 10:10 am-12:00 pm (Taiwan time)
Grades: 4th
year
Credits: 2
Instructor: Mr. Matthias Wetzel (wetzel@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
This course strives to provide students to the fundamentals of trade secret protection.
It is suitable for both students with and without a legal background.
The Course Features
“What is a trade secret?”, “What means ‘Know-how’?”, “How can they be protected
and what are the requirements for their legal protection?”. These are some of the
questions that will be explained and answered to the students in this course.
Protection of know-how and trade secrets plays a vital and ever more important role
in a globalized and knowledge-based economy. Though seemingly cheap and
ubiquitous and therefore particularly attractive notably for small and medium-sized
companies with limited financial budgets and resources for IP protection, also trade
secret protection comes with its specific price: Existence and unlawful disclosure of a
trade secret are difficult to prove; unlike for patents an other IP rights a uniform
international legal framework for the protection of trade secrets does not yet exist.
Therefore, this course aims to provide the participants with an insight in both, the
chances but also the practical and legal problems and risks that come with trade secret
protection.

Course Time: 15:10 pm-18:00 pm (Taiwan time)
Grades: 3rd
& 4th
year
Credits: 3
Instructor: Dr. Chih-Bang Hsiao (chb-hsiao@asia.edu.tw)/ Dr. Song-Lin
Huang (slh4221@asia.edu.tw)
About the Course
The course starts with introducing social policy and legislation concepts, such as social
policy history, definition, related theory, and perspectives from different angles. It
then proceeds to apply the concepts in social work practices by inviting the
international students at Asia University to work with clients to help clients recover
from struggling in a difficult time. Social policy and social legislation are essential parts
of ""indirect service"" in social work. The standard, definition, and effect of ""direct
service"" play a vital role. Therefore, as a learner of social work, in addition to the study
of direct service and its skills, it is also necessary to understand the connotation,
history, and related theories of social policy, and have an understanding of social
legislation in various fields. The connotation is applied beyond the direct service. It
can deduct or evaluate its impact on the direct service based on social policies from
different positions and analyze the pros and cons of various policies.
The Course Features
The course aims to cultivate students’ abilities to analyze and link social policies and
direct services. They would also gain knowledge of the relevant theories, concepts, or
ideologies learned in the course to deduce its policy connotation and influence, and
further provide insights on the revision of policies and laws in Taiwan.
Starting from the needs of the service target, assess and criticize the impact of relevant
policies or regulations on the service target so that the formulation of social policies
can better meet the service target's needs. Meanwhile, students will have Social
welfare-related institutions field visit through video camera(s).

About the Course
This course focuses on practicality, and more about the use of design methods, such
as the guiding role of product instructional semantics on human operation and
emotional semantics on human emotions, which can promote the development of
humanized design. The method of semantic design is based on the synesthesia
produced by the mutual influence of semantic stimuli on different senses. This course
uses more contrasting techniques to enhance the fun of reading, such as modifying
the existing products to generate new semantic meanings, allowing students to
understand the influence of each link of the shape on semantic features. In addition,
looking for emotional resonance in life as a starting point for semantic design methods,
etc., can enable students to understand the value of semantics in design in a relatively
short period of time, and find a design breakthrough that suits them.
The Course Features
This course starts from the angle that students can accept and understand more easily,
expound the basic knowledge of semantics in a more cordial way, and summarize some
semantic design methods.
